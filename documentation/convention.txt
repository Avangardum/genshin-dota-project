Private members should never be used outside of their object
All dependencies between modules should be listed in architecture.txt
Modules cannot use members of other modules, unless they are dependent on these modules
Functions should assert their preconditions and postconditions in their beginning and end (right before the return statement)
Functions should check types of their arguments using assertions from my_util
