Private Functions                       : _SampleText
Public variables                        : sampleText
Private variables                       : _sampleText
Public constants                        : SAMPLE_TEXT
Private constants                       : _SAMPLE_TEXT
Arguments                               : sampleText

Private members should never be used outside of their module
All dependencies between modules should be listed in architecture.txt
Modules cannot use members of other modules, unless they are dependent on these modules
Functions should assert their preconditions and postconditions in their beginning and end (right before the return statement)
Functions should check types of their arguments using assertions from util
